# Recipe Website

With its easy-to-use interface, the recipe website is a great place to share recipes. Aptly named unlimited, the goal is that allergies and other diet-related limitations should not limit one’s access to great recipes. Presently, the collection represents my friends’ favorites, irrespective of any limitation.  
Powered by PHP and MySQL, the project incorporates many web development goodies, both from the frond end and backend. Check out the [website](http://unlimitedrecipes.myartsonline.com/), and feel free to add some of your own recipes!
